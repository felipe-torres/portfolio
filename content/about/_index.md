Hi! My name is Felipe Torres Perugachi, a software engineer that loves the creative media. Be it games, virtual experiences or apps, I'm always eager to learn new skills and solve problems with a mixture of technological and artistic ideas. I'm also very passionate about sharing knowledge and working with others with the use of the Internet as a platform to do so.

![This is me][1]

When not coding, eating or sleeping, I'm playing music, videogames, singing, drawing/painting or reading. I've lived in Quito, Guayaquil, Querétaro, Mexico City and Cancún, all beautiful cities with unique cultures, landscapes and wonderful people. I occassionaly compose and produce music with a (really basic, but cherished) home recording studio, and sometimes collaborate with musician friends to perform or record songs.

#### Experience

I've been working as a full-time developer since I graduated in 2015, plus the time I've spent on my personal games and projects. During this period, I've worked on 3D and 2D projects (apps, games and experiences) targeted for mobile platforms (Android and iOS), PC and VR (Google Cardboard, Oculus) and consoles. I've covered different game related tasks such as gameplay programming, artificial intelligence, UI programming, shader development, game architecture, and so on. Also, I've cofounded the indie studio RadishBox where me and a colleague design, plan and develop games and apps created by ourselves.
