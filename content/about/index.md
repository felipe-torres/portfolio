Hi! My name is Felipe Torres Perugachi, a software engineer with love for the creative medium. As a firm believer in autodidacticism, I'm always eager to learn new technologies and overcome obstacles with innovative ideas based on a technological and creative background.

![This is me][1]

When not coding (\*gasp\*), eating or sleeping, I'm playing music, videogames, singing or drawing/painting. I've lived in Quito, Guayaquil, Querétaro and Mexico City, all beautiful cities with unique cultures and people. I occassionaly play in a folk band with various instruments, including the accordion, piano, guitar, ocarina, charango and ukulele. Also, every now and then I like to compose little melodies (nothing big, really). My mexican friends used to calling me an "estuche de monerías", which means "jack of all trades".
