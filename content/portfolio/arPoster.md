Exploring the Unity AR Foundation for image tracking.

#### What?

I started to develop this project to learn more about the AR Foundation capabilities in Unity. Also, as I just finished the 2019 Inktober challenge ([check it out here!](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/xz0P9Y)) I wanted to use those drawings as art assets for this project.

This experiment uses:

* Ar image tracking (AR Foundation)
* Stencil shaders
* Sprite animations
* Particle effects
