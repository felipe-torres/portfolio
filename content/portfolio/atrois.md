#### Description

> "Atrois is an adventure puzzle game, in which you control two characters that are carrying a little "something" throughout the levels."

##### Game Design & Mechanics

The player start as primitives that move in 2D, where they don't really have a clue that there's something happening. As they progress, the scenary starts to get more complex, and the characters acquire humanlike shape and animations. As the graphics become clearer, the player starts to get what's really happening and the story behind a third "character" in the game.

Both characters are controlled by the same controller or keyboard and can be played by a single player or two players (each holding one side of the controller or playing with one side of the keyboard). Each character has a special ability: one of the them can jump and the other one can fit through small gaps.
