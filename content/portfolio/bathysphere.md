Educational iPad game about discovering and cataloging fish.

<!--more-->

![Surface][1]

##### General Info

* **Developer:** 
**[RadishBox](http://www.radishbox.com/)**
* **Release date:**
May, 2015
* **Platforms:**
iPad, PC

#### Description

> *"Submerge the seas in Bathysphere, and encounter and catalog different species of fish."*

This game was co-developed as a research project when I studied at the [Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/), aimed to test game design methods to appeal to learning based on a more ludic experience.

##### Game Design & Mechanics

The main goals of this game was to teach players about different species of fish and where they inhabited.

These goals, translated to game mechanics were:

* Player carries a log of species they discover, with a data page about it inside (sort of like a pokedex).
* Levels are scattered around the globe, divided in areas. Each area is a real marine zone.
* Each level is played vertically, from the sea surface to the bottom.
* During each level, the player moves the ipad around or the mouse to control the camera.
* In order to catalog a certain species, the player must "scan" it with the camera during a variable amount of time.
* This amount of time varies depending on the species. The "rarer" the species, the harder it gets.
* Difficulty of scanning a certain species varies according to: its size, its speed and depth at which it spawns.
* Species must spawn randomly and with increasing rate.

##### Features

* Procedurally animated water and ocean floor, with perlin noise.
* All species have a simple A.I., following a 3D steering behaviour.

#### Roles & Tasks

I worked on this game with my artist friend Pablo Mendizabal (You can check more of his amazing work **[here](https://pablom2.artstation.com/)**). We developed the concept, came up with the mechanics, planned & managed the development and release via Google Play. 

Being a part of a two-man team, I occuppied different roles with varying tasks from concept creation to delivering the final product:

* **Game design:** 

Came up with core game mechanics and expanding around them. Paper prototype testing and game balancing.

* **Project management:**

Used **[Trello](https://trello.com/)** as a kanban board to organize and delegate tasks.

* **Software engineering:**

Designed and developed the game architecture. Managed version control with **[Git+Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)**. Planned and carried out tests.  

* **Gameplay, UI and shader programming:**

Developed designed game mechanics. Programmed the technical solution based on the designed architecture. Coded high and low level behaviours. Co-designed and programmed the UI. Coded procedural behaviours.
