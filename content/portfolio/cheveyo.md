Global Game Jam 2016: mobile game about hearing and catching audio.

<!--more-->

#### Description

> "Cheveyo is a game where your meditation must not be broken. Focus on the incoming sounds to gather the energy sand you need to fill your own sand jar and stop the world from an impending doom."

##### Game Design & Mechanics

The player uses their phone in this game to look around (using the gyroscope if available). It's necessary for them to use headphones, as they must hear the auditive waves of colored sand they need to collect (3d audio). The goal of the game is to collect the colored sand in the order shown at the beginning of each round.
