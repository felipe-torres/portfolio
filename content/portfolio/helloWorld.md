#### Description

> "A journey of enlightenment by waving others hello. Hello World is a wave survival game where the player is a deity and has to enlighten his followers by holy-waving action (greeting them). Activate these "hello's" and "good days" by speaking commands into your mic! Psst: Get rid of them by insulting them."

![Waving][1]

##### Game Design & Mechanics

In this game, the player uses the mic to speak greeting commands (waving them hello) to fend of against hordes (or waves) of followers.

Phrase recognition is done through Windows10's capabilities.
