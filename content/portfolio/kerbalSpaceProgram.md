*"In Kerbal Space Program, take charge of the space program for the alien race known as the Kerbals. You have access to an array of parts to assemble fully-functional spacecraft that fly (or donâ€™t) based on realistic aerodynamic and orbital physics. Launch your Kerbal crew into orbit and beyond (while keeping them alive) to explore moons and planets in the Kerbol solar system, constructing bases and space stations to expand the reach of your expedition."*

#### Roles & Tasks

I worked on this project with a multi-disciplinary team of other programmers, artists, game designers and producers at Squad. As the 2020 pandemic hit, we transitioned to a 100% remote work environment. 

As this game originally launched in 2015, my main roles for the development of the game were: developing new features for free and paid expansions of the game, and the analysis and solving of bugs of already existing features.

Following the release of the last update, I started working as a consultant for Private Division, who were developing the sequel, KSP2, on parallel.
