*"With the original Kerbal Space Program having become one of the most beloved games of all time and now bigger than ever, Kerbal Space Program 2 has been fully redesigned from the ground up to meet the demands of modern and next-generation space exploration, all while maintaining the monumental foundations of the first game. Build a space program, construct powerful spacecraft, design resource-gathering colonies, and much more to uncover the secrets of the galaxy. A plethora of exciting new features will captivate veteran and returning players, as well as usher in a whole new wave of Kerbonauts to the ingenious and comedic world that has entertained millions of players."*

#### Roles & Tasks

I started worked on this project shortly after the release of the last update of KSP1, working as a consultant engineer for Private Division. 

I was invited to join the VFX team for the development of this game, so my main tasks consisted in designing, developing and maintaining VFX and audio systems, as well as the creation of tools to be used for artists to help them iterate faster over art asset creation and testing.
