VR crane prototype designed to work with the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion input.

![crane leap motion][1]

***

This prototype was created to understand the capabilities of Leap Motion for controlling a crane through the use of virtual levers on the Oculus Rift. It uses physics joints with rotational limits and motor forces to control the different parts of the crane. The levers and button react to hand gestures with physics collision.  

It also makes use of Valve's renderer **['The Lab'](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/63141)**.

#### What?

**[Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/)** is a hardware technology that detects hand movement and (to some extent) hand gesture recognition (think kinect but for your hands). When mounted on a VR headset, it lets you use your hands as some sort of gesture controller, giving you the ability to interact with the virtual world with your hands.
