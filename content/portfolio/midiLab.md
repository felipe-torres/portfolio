Exploring the Unity engine as an environment for creating live music visuals through MIDI input.

<!--more-->

#### What?

I started to develop this project to learn how I could use an app made in Unity3D to create visuals for a live music setting (for a personal music project). 

This ongoing lab, which is built upon the fantastic work of keijiro (https://github.com/keijiro/Minis), takes MIDI input and shows various effects according to the input played.
