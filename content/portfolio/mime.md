#### Description

> *"⬜◼️◽▪️ Meaningfullnes In (Mostly) Everything ▪️◽◼️⬜"*

This game was made for the [Ludum Dare #42: "Running out of space"](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/mime) in which a game is made in 72 hours.

It's hosted in [itch.io](https://felipe-perugachi.itch.io/mime), and an APK can be ontained from the site.


##### Game Design & Mechanics

I worked with artist [Itzel Martínez](https://www.artstation.com/itzelmf) to design and create a quick game for this Ludum Dare. We wanted to make a comical physics based project, which would deform a 3D body by reducing the space on the screen whenever the player tapped the wrong input.

#### Roles & Tasks

I was in charge of programming and integrating the art assets in Unity, as well as deploying and testing the game in mobile. I also designed the UX and audio.
