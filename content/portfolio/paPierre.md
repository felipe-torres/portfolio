* **Platforms:**
**PC**

#### Description

> *"Pa'Pierre is a 3D adventure platformer game starring Pierre, a piece of paper who tries to find it's place on this world. A story of self improvement on two (very) short levels"*

This game was the very first I designed and developed for a course on 3D videogame development at the [Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/). Being the first it holds a special place in my heart :green_heart:.

##### Game Design & Mechanics

I wanted to create a game where a piece of paper starting out as trash 'evolved' through levels, acquiring new movement abilities to reach new places. Starting as a crumpled ball of paper and later morphing to a bipedal sheet of paper.
