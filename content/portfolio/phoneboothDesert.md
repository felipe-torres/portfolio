#### What?

I made this experiment based on a dream I had once, where I woke up on a red sofa in the middle of a desert filled with phone booths. Each time I picked a receiver it emitted random sounds and voices. I decided to make this dream in Unity and throw in connectivity with the Soundcloud API through the use of external calls. 

This expermient done in **Unity3D** uses:

* [External calls](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application.ExternalCall.html) 
* [Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide) to obtain random tracks and info related to those tracks (artist, track description, image)
* Lightmapping
* Models and texturing done in Blender
