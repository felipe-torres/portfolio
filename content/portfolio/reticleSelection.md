Reusable Unity components to add reticle selection system functionality.

<!--more-->

***

This component was created by extending Unity's reticle functionality in the **[VRSamples package](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51519)**. adding reticle animations through the use of Demigiant's **[DOTween](http://dotween.demigiant.com/)** and allowing OnClick, OnOver and OnOut events to interactive objects.

This work was developed while working at **Yeltic**: http://yeltic.com/en/
