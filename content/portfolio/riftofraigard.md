#### Roles & Tasks

I worked on this project along a team of other programmers and artists at Dun Rite Games. My main role was being a gameplay programmer and I worked on different aspects of the game:

* **Gameplay programming:** 

Developed and mantained sprite loading systems, particle effect systems and other effects. As such, I worked closely with the art team, for the continuous integration of art assets into the game.

* **Game design:** 

Worked in the team responsible for testing and coming up with game mechanics.

* **Software engineering:**

Helped develop and design the game architecture.

* **Audio:** 

Designed and developed dynamic audio system.

* **Backend:** 

Managed gameplay data with Gamesparks

This work (which is currently in development) was done while working at **Dun Rite Games**: https://dunritegames.gg/
