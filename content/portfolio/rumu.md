Global Game Jam 2019: A glimpse of coziness, that reminds us of home.

<!--more-->

#### Description

> "A glimpse of coziness, that reminds us of home."

I worked with digital artist [Itzel Martínez](https://www.artstation.com/itzelmf) to design and create a very quick experience for the 2019 Global Game Jam. The theme was 'What home means to you'.
