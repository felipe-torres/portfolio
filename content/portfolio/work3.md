Lightmapping of a single room with static lights for a project targeted for mobile, both Android and iOS.

<!--more-->

***

Since the project's target platform was mobile, both iOS and Android, it had to run pretty smoothly. What's more, it needed to run on stereoscopic view, for the Google Cardboard. 

With this solution, it ran at about 30 fps even on a 1gb ram iPhone 5.
