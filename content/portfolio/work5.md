#### Single option selector

> I developed this UI component for instances where the user needs to choose one of multiple options. 

For this specific version, a single option is shown at any time. The user can scroll through the options and choose them using configurable inputs. 

During development, the developer defines each option content and action associated to it (a Unity Event) and may choose a prefab to instantiate for each option. The developer can also choose whether to include a response timer or not, and configure the time the user has to choose an option. The developer may also include a default action that occurs if time runs out before the user chooses.

This work was developed while working at **Yeltic**: http://yeltic.com/en/
